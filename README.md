This repository contains a simple Python example demonstrating a common `TypeError` that arises from performing arithmetic operations on incompatible data types (specifically, attempting to add a string to an integer). The example showcases a robust solution to avoid the error.

The `bug.py` file illustrates the error and the `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected and more robust version.
